**Students Exam Score Analysis using Python**


This project is focused on analyzing exam scores of students using Python. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful insights from the dataset.

**Overview**
Exams are an integral part of assessing students' academic performance. Analyzing exam scores can provide valuable insights into various factors affecting students' performance and help in identifying trends that can improve educational outcomes.

In this project, we use Python and popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. The dataset used contains information about students' exam scores along with other relevant attributes.

**Key Features**
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data normalization, and formatting.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the distribution of scores, identifying correlations between different variables, and gaining insights into factors influencing exam performance.

Visualization: Creating informative plots and graphs to visually represent trends and patterns in the data.

Statistical Analysis: Applying statistical methods to validate findings and draw conclusions.



**Project Structure**
The project is structured as follows:

data/: Directory containing the dataset(s) used in the analysis.

notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks used for data analysis and visualization.

scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, analysis, and any other tasks.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project, instructions for setup, and usage.
